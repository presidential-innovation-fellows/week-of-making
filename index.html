      <h1>Celebrate the National Week of Making</h1>
      <p>The White House recently announced the 2016 National Week of Making (June 17-23) and has invited libraries, museums, rec centers, schools, universities and community spaces to support and grow the number of our citizen-makers by hosting events, committing to take action, and highlighting new innovations.</p>
      <p>As highlighted on <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1Xd3tXL" target="blank">a recent blog post</a> by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, this year’s celebration is a continuation of the President’s Nation of Makers initiative launched in June 2014, when President Obama hosted the first-ever White House Maker Faire and issued a call to action that “every company, every college, every community, every citizen joins us as we lift up makers and builders and doers across the country.”</p>
      <p>Last year, President Obama expanded from the single event by proclaiming a National Week of Making and inviting people of all ages to hold events around the country celebrating ingenuity, inspiring creative problem-solving, and supporting opportunities for those from all backgrounds to tinker and make. The Presidential Innovation Fellows program is happy to respond to the President’s call by getting involved, spreading the word, and helping organize events. Below are some suggestions about how you can get involved too!</p>
